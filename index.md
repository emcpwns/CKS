## Resource Details
### Hemp
**Era Unlocked:** Colonial  
**Resources:** 800 Cannabis --> 800 Hemp  
**Notes:** Considerably more valuable before the Cold War. Nearly worthless as an export by Modern times; but mantains its value due to cloth, apperal, and power production uses.  

### Cannabutter
**Era Unlocked:** Colonial  
**Resources:** 150 Milk + 150 Cannabis --> 300 Cannabutter  
**Notes:** Price curve closely follows Cannabis, making this resource fairly stable in value.  

### Joints
**Era Unlocked:** World Wars  
**Resources:** 250 Cannabis --> 1000 Joints  
**Notes:** High profit margin but also high volume which can stress infrastructure.  

### Blunts
**Era Unlocked:** World Wars  
**Resources:** 500 Cannabis --> 750 Blunts  
**Notes:** Not as high a profit margin as Joints, but the upgrade significantly increases Cigar Factory production.

### Dabs
**Era Unlocked:** Modern  
**Resources:** 1000 Cannabis --> 350 Dabs  
**Notes:** Helps reduce export volume, makes a decent profit, and can be made into edibles for considerably more profit.  

### Edibles
**Era Unlocked:** Modern  
**Resources:** 200 Dabs --> 400 Edibles  
**Notes:** The upgrade runs a pricey budget, but effectivley doubles dab profits.
