## Building & Upgrade Details
### New Building: Medical Cannabis Dispensary
This helpful building will distribute cannabis to your sick citizens. Available as soon as the game starts, the healthcare provided starts out worse than any of the vanilla healthcare buildings. However, with new upgrades every era, it can become one of the best and can even generate some profit.

### Cannabis Plantation Upgrade
**Hippy Commune -** Doubles workforce & budget of the cannabis plantation, increases effectivness by 125. Can also work great to soak up a lot of unemployed illiterate Tropicans.  

### New Building: Hemp Factory
This small hemp processining workshop (modeled on the Jewlery Factory) comes with multiple upgrades, and allows you to produce hemp for your islands industrial needs.  

### Cigar Factory Upgrades
**Roll Joints -** Processes cannabis into joints. (Can be stressful on teamsters so the Resource Manager mod is highly reccomended.)  
**Roll Blunts -** Processes cannabis into blunts.  

### Creamery Upgrade (Requires DLC)
**Churn Cannabutter -** Processes cannabis and milk into cannabutter.  

### New Building: Biofuel Plant
This wonder of technology available only to Tropicans who truly believe, processes hemp directly into electricity! Amazing!  

### Textile Mill Upgrade
**Hemp Fiber Blend -** Processes Hemp, Cotton, & Wool (all required) into lots of cloth.  

### Fashion Company Upgrade
**Hemp Fiber Blend -** Further infuse hemp into your clothing. Processes hemp and cloth into lots of appearal.

## Resource Details
### Hemp
**Era Unlocked:** Colonial  
**Resources:** 800 Cannabis --> 800 Hemp  
**Notes:** Considerably more valuable before the Cold War. Nearly worthless as an export by Modern times; but mantains its value due to cloth, apperal, and power production uses.  

### Cannabutter
**Era Unlocked:** Colonial  
**Resources:** 150 Milk + 150 Cannabis --> 300 Cannabutter  
**Notes:** Price curve closely follows Cannabis, making this resource fairly stable in value.  

### Joints
**Era Unlocked:** World Wars  
**Resources:** 250 Cannabis --> 1000 Joints  
**Notes:** High profit margin but also high volume which can stress infrastructure.  

### Blunts
**Era Unlocked:** World Wars  
**Resources:** 500 Cannabis --> 750 Blunts  
**Notes:** Not as high a profit margin as Joints, but the upgrade significantly increases Cigar Factory production.

### Dabs
**Era Unlocked:** Modern  
**Resources:** 1000 Cannabis --> 350 Dabs  
**Notes:** Helps reduce export volume, makes a decent profit, and can be made into edibles for considerably more profit.  

### Edibles
**Era Unlocked:** Modern  
**Resources:** 200 Dabs --> 400 Edibles  
**Notes:** The upgrade runs a pricey budget, but effectivley doubles dab profits.  Can also be traded for improved foreign relations.
